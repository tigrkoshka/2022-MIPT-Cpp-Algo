//
// In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that,
// there is exactly one node (the root) for which all other nodes
// are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent,
// except for the root node which has no parents.
//
// The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree
// with n nodes (with distinct values from 1 to n), with one additional
// directed edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen
// from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed.
//
// The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges
// is a pair [ui, vi] that represents a directed edge connecting
// nodes ui and vi, where ui is a parent of child vi.
//
// Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph
// is a rooted tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers,
// return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

    //------------------------------Phase 1---------------------------------

    // In this phase we try to find a vertex that has two parents,
    // in which case the answer is one of the respective edges

    // Semantics: parent[i] is the parent of the i-th edge that we have last
    // encountered. Because edges contain the edges of a valid tree
    // plus one extra edge, it can be guaranteed that no more than one
    // collision can occur, and we are looking specifically for that
    // collision (if it exists). So if by the time we want to write
    // j to parent[i], it already has k (â‰  0, because the vertices are
    // 1-indexed) stored in it, then the collision is
    // that i has two parents: j and k.
    //
    // Since edges contain all edges of a valid tree
    // plus one extra edge, the size of edges equals the number of vertices,
    // but since vertices are 1-indexed, unlike the vector, we create
    // a vector of a size that is 1 bigger than the edges size and consider
    // the 0-th element invalid
    vector<int> parent(edges.size() + 1);

    // The edges connecting the two parents of the vertex
    // in question. So, in the above example candidates will be
    // the {j, i} and the {k, i} edges.
    //
    // For one of them we store itself, for another we store its index
    // in the edges vector. That type of storage is simply an optimization
    // for the following checks and does not affect the semantics of
    // the algorithm
    //
    // If we don't found a collision, the former will be an empty vector
    // and the latter will be SIZE_T_MAX (which we denote as -1 only because
    // Leetcode cannot compile SIZE_T_MAX and UINT64_MAX would be incorrect
